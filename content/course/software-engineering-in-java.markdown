[Java](/categories/java) is quite simply the most popular programming language in the world.
With all the legacy Java applications that need to be maintained and the
new ones created every day in so many different domains, mastery of Java
will guarantee you will always be in demand. Take the first step to achieving that goal now.

## Description
According to
[Oracle](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=458&get_params=p_track_id:JSE7Prog),
3 billion devices run Java. Google chose Java for [Android](/tags/android), and the [Hadoop](/tags/hadoop)
[Big Data](/categories/big-data) ecosystem is built on Java as well. There is tremendous opportunity to do great work in something you love, 
but there is a reason not every developer is taking advantage of it.

Being good at Java--like *really* good--is hard. Especially with all the changes to the language over the years.

*Software Engineering in Java* establishes the foundation of basic constructs like conditionals and loops. The
course builds on this foundation with a thorough treatment of object-oriented programming and software engineering
best practices to enable you to build sophisticated Java programs in the real world.

## What makes this course different
The typical Java course teaches you how to write code in Java but not how to *engineer* in Java. You come back to work
completely unprepared for the challenges you will face when your team expects you to deliver for a real customer.

*Software Engineering in Java* operates from the premise that the greatest
asset in professional software development isn't what you know but *how fast you can adapt*. Here
you solve unfamiliar problems by consulting your teammates and
Google and
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:1347281+[java])
for ideas. Just like every day at work. Skills typically
ignored by other Java courses like testing and error handling become second nature. The course concludes with a
brief discussion of other languages that build on Java's legacy like
[Scala](/tags/scala), Clojure, and [Kotlin](/tags/kotlin).

When you finish this course, you will be a *professional* Java engineer.

## About the instructor
Neil Chaudhuri is self-taught in Java with many years of experience delivering large-scale solutions ranging from [REST](/tags/rest)
services to web and [mobile](/tags/mobile) and [Big Data](/categories/big-data) applications for government and commercial
clients.

Neil also has multiple [Java badges on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1347281/vidya?tab=badges). He was even 
a Sun Certified Java Programmer when that was still a thing.
