Learn from a [Scrum](/tags/scrum) expert with years of experience in software development. Move beyond [agile](/categories/agile) platitudes and use
Scrum to solve the real-life problems that happen
on projects so you can deliver high-quality software to customers on time and under budget.

For more information, [contact us](/contact).

## Description
Everyone knows the waterfall approach almost never produces
high-quality software on time and on budget. The problem is so many are eager to call themselves "agile" or to sell
"agile" that no one really knows what it means anymore. As a result, many teams who think they are agile still fail.

*Agile Software Project Management with Scrum* reminds everyone of the core agile values by describing how good teams
apply them in real projects using Scrum, the most popular agile framework. Entertaining instruction and provocative
exercises combine lessons from experts with real-life experience to go beyond the theory and help make software
development fun again.

## What makes this course different
The typical Scrum course describes a lot of abstract principles that sound great. It also leaves you to
fend for yourself after the class is over and a bunch of things happen that you never covered, so you revert to old habits
as if the course never happened. After all, you need to get things done.

And don't get us started on the silly exercises that have you wishing you could just get back to work.

In *Agile Software Project Management with Scrum*, we explore how large organizations you've actually heard of have
thrived with Scrum. The exercises are also a lot more compelling--particularly when you
will team with others to build a real software application using Scrum. Finally,
you will learn literally dozens of "recipes" for overcoming the common challenges we all face when we build software for real
customers.

## Format
Three four-hour onsite sessions with lecture and group exercises.

An alternate online version is coming, but with a topic like Scrum, the onsite version is recommended for the group interaction.

*[Effective Practices and Federal Challenges in Applying Agile Methods](http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/593091.pdf)*
He also lent his agile software development and technical expertise to a team assembled by the 
Executive Office of the President of the United States to [revolutionize federal government contracting of digital
services](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/digital-service-contracting-professional-training-and-development-program-challenge-2/) 
to maximize value for American taxpayers through agile development and [open-source](/categories/open-source). He is currently

## Syllabus

### Session I: The Scrum Solution
* Why the waterfall approach, and more broadly the construction metaphor, doesn't apply to software development
* Why the agile solution, and more broadly the lean product development metaphor, is superior
* Case studies of major companies and real metrics conveying the benefits of an agile approach
* Debunking myths about agile like the absence of planning and documentation
* Scrum terminology and concepts

### Session II: Scrum Applied
* The day-to-day activities of a Scrum project at the product planning, release planning, sprint planning, and daily planning levels
* The crucial difference between user stories and tasks, when each applies, and how to estimate each
* Using velocity and other metrics to track project health and improve visibility throughout the organization
* Centerpiece exercise: a Scrum project where teams build an actual software application with all the trimmings: product
planning, sprints, reviews and retrospectives, etc.

### Session III: Scrum in Real Life
* Overcoming the common challenges that emerge during a software project--at the organization and team levels as well as
with distributed teams
* Lesson conveyed in a "cookbook" style describing each problem, a quick solution, and the details of the solution
* Ten examples of the problems that are addressed
    - *You want to try Scrum with your team, but your organization hasn't embraced it.*
    - *The organization is unsure how to measure the success of its agile adoption.*
    - *The Product Owner is unavailable when needed or takes too long to answer questions.*
    - *There is pressure to sacrifice quality for faster delivery of critical features before an imminent deadline.*
    - *You aren't confident in your forecasts because your estimates are always wrong.*
    - *The team is unable to estimate the size of a story because no one is familiar with the technology.*
    - *You don't know whether sized stories or estimated tasks are the best way to pay down technical debt.*
    - *It is difficult to make commitments because the size of the team changes frequently.*
    - *Cultural differences present an obstacle for geographically distributed teams.*
