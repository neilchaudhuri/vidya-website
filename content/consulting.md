At Vidya we are committed to making technology work for you. One way we do that is by providing [courses](/course),
[tutorials](/tutorial), and [blog posts](/blog) so you can learn concepts on your own. We are certified by both 
[CRMSDC](/blog/welcoming-crmsdc-diversity-technology-consulting-minority-owned-business.markdown) and 
[USPAACC](/blog/welcoming-uspaacc-diversity-technology-consulting-minority-owned-business.markdown) as a minority-owned business.

We are also available to join your team to help build high-quality software applications *fast* in whatever capacity you need.
Software project management, high-level architecture, guidance on implementing efficiencies like continuous delivery,
or what we love most--software application development using the world's leading-edge, and at times
bleeding-edge, technologies.

We also have experience addressing the challenges of building software in United States government classified facilities.

Take a look at what we can do. If you would like to discuss consulting opportunities, please [contact](/contact) us.

## Technologies

We specialize in these disciplines and technologies:

- **Services:** REST, Microservices, Serverless, GraphQL, gRPC
- **Programming languages:** Scala, Go, Kotlin, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Dart
- **Mobile:** Android and iOS, Flutter, Progressive Web Applications
- **Big data analytics:** Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, MongoDB, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, RDBMS
- **UI:** React, Vue, D3, Elm, RxJS
- **Web:** Play Framework, Spring Boot, Go kit, Gatsby, Hugo, Rails, Ktor
- **Cloud Native:** AWS, Azure, Heroku, Netlify
- **Miscellaneous:** Akka, Alpakka

You will notice that there are pervasive technologies like .NET and PHP we don't mention here. We want to
be honest. We can get up to speed on other technologies fairly quickly, but they aren't our thing.
We want to do only certain things and do them well.

If you would like to discuss consulting opportunities, please [contact](/contact) us.

## Software Engineering

As important as technology is, it is even more important to build software the right way. The right tools
and automation enable us to build fast and build quality. You can have both.

We specialize in these development practices and tools:

- **Testing:** JUnit, ScalaTest, ScalaCheck, Cucumber, Selenium, Cypress, Nightwatch, WireMock, Pact
- **Version control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **Continuous Delivery:** Docker, Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub, Kubernetes, OpenShift, SonarQube
- **Build tools:** SBT, Gradle, Maven

We also are focused on design and architectural patterns and what Bob Martin calls "[clean code](http://www.cleancoders.com/)"

## Software Project Management

Every software project is different with unique circumstances--the team, the business goals, the
technical goals, market forces, and so on. It takes the right kind of approach to tackle the challenges that arise
and produce high-quality software fast.

We specialize in Design Thinking and [lean]((/categories/lean)) and [agile](/categories/agile) software development. We know those terms are hard to disambiguate. We can help. 

Our personnel are [PMP](/tags/pmp)- and [Scrum](/tags/scrum)-certified.

## Technology communications

A lot of people believe that software engineers are anti-social nerds who like to pound away in the corner on their
keyboards and would rather face [World of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/) villains that human customers.

That can be true. But not at Vidya.

Technology is meaningless without the ability to express its power through engaging verbal and
written communication. Whether explaining the value and risk of a particular technology to
customers or writing concise but thorough prose in a proposal, we can communicate our technical expertise effectively
to reach the goals you have set for your organization.

In fact, it may be our communications that really set us apart.
