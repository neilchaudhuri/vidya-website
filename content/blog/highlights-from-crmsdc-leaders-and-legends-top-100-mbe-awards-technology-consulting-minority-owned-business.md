On October 3, I was lucky enough to represent Vidya at the [Capital Region Minority Supplier Development Council](http://www.crmsdc.org/)
(CRMSDC) Leaders & Legends Awards ceremony at MGM National Harbor, where we received an award as a Top 100 Minority-Owned 
Business (MBE) and a nomination for 2019 Supplier of the Year in our class.

It was an amazing night with great food and drink, celebrities like Roland Martin and Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), and 
most importantly, an opportunity to meet the most successful minority business owners in the DC area.

I got a picture with Senator Cardin on the red carpet!

And I made some friends. The opportunity to meet so many of the most accomplished leaders in the DC area and absorb their 
insight was priceless.

As the night continued, it was humbling to be on stage with the other Top 100 MBEs. Can you spot me?

In case you're wondering, we did not win the award for Supplier of the Year. We are just getting started, and 
even being nominated is a tremendous honor. So it's cool. For now.

We did get a nice plaque as a Top 100 MBE though.
