Every week [Petr Zapletal](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/petr-zapletal/4a/965/540), a software engineer at Cake Solutions,
publishes a must-read post for [Scala](/tags/scala) developers called quite intuitively *This Week in #Scala*.
We are proud to announce that our latest tutorial
*[Nine Reasons to Try Scala](/tutorial/Scala/Java/Python/Groovy/Mobile/Android/Web/REST/Architecture/Programming/2015/04/03/nine-reasons-to-try-scala)*
was featured in [this weekâ€™s edition](http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/this-week-in-scala-27/04/2015).

We would like to thank Petr for thinking enough of our tutorial to include it in *This Week in #Scala*. Please check it
out this week and every week for the latest news on the Scala ecosystem.
