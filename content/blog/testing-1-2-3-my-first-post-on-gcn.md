In the wake of the project management and technology debacle that is [HealthCare.gov](www.healthcare.gov),
I just published [my first post on Government Computing News](http://gcn.com/Articles/2013/12/10/software-testing.aspx),
the leading online publication in federal IT.

The topic?

> Testing is much more nuanced than has been suggested by recent commentary. Developers, testers, and domain experts can work together to leverage a combination of open-source tools, automation and discipline in order to build quality into their applications from the start.
