As [promised](/blog/2015/04/22/analytics-with-apache-spark-is-coming)
earlier this year, we at Vidya are proud to officially announce our newest course 
[Analytics with Apache Spark](/course/analytics-with-apache-spark). 
Spark is a cool technology making an enormous--and growing--impact in the Big Data space, so naturally there are a lot
of courses out there. Ours is different. 

Naturally we spend a lot of time on Spark itself with numerous code examples and challenging
exercises, but we also stress the importance of things that have always mattered and still matter--architecture, security, 
and software engineering concepts like unit and integration testing, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Courses
seem to ignore these concerns even though they are actually *more* important in a complex, distributed environment. 

We even survey many of the other leading analytics tools out there so you can get a feel for your options and make informed 
technical decisions.   

All of this distinguishes [our Spark course](/course/analytics-with-apache-spark) 
from all the others. We hope you will consider it if you want to make your mark
in the [Big Data](/categories/big-data) landscape.

Feel free to check out our other courses too--[Software Engineering in Java](/course/software-engineering-in-java)
and [Agile Software Project Management with Scrum](/course/agile-software-project-management-with-scrum).
