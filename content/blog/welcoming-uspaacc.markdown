With a new year upon us, I am very proud to announce that the the 
[US Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation](https://uspaacc.com/)
(USPAACC) has certified Vidya as an Asian and minority-owned small business.

Since I started Vidya, we have been very privileged to work with a wide array of commercial and government clients to deliver 
high-quality software using exciting technology while promoting [lean](/tags/lean) principles, [agile](/tags/agile) software development,
and diversity in software engineering. The best part about it? It's been fun! Doing great work and contributing to the community (whether on 
[our blog](/blog/), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1347281/vidya),
[GitHub](https://github.com/VidyaSource), [conferences](/blog/2017/06/05/speaking-at-code-writers-workshop-2017/), and even 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)) has been the most rewarding professional experience of my life.  

Certification by USPAACC shows the world that Vidya has demonstrated the kind of growth potential that should make businesses 
who need technology services take notice. USPAACC's [mission](https://uspaacc.com/about) is 
"to be the gateway to corporate and government contracts...and...Pan Asian American...suppliers." We look forward to building
new relationships and expanding our services to even more clients in the Washington, DC, area and beyond.   

We want to thank USPAACC for recognizing Vidya's past success and future potential, and we cannot wait to do business
with all of you.
