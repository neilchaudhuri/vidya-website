With a new year upon us, I am very proud to announce that the the 
[US Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce Education Foundation](https://uspaacc.com/)
(USPAACC) has certified Vidya as an Asian and minority-owned small business.

At Vidya, we have been very privileged to deliver high-quality software to a wide array of commercial and government clients
using exciting technology while promoting [lean](/tags/lean) principles, [agile](/tags/agile) software development,
and diversity in software engineering. The best part about it? It's been fun! Doing great work and contributing to the community--whether 
writing on [our blog](/blog/), answering questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1347281/vidya),
contributing to open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/VidyaSource), 
speaking at [conferences](/blog/2017/06/05/speaking-at-code-writers-workshop-2017/), and even posting video tutorials on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)--have been the most rewarding professional experience of my life.  

Certification by USPAACC shows the world that Vidya has demonstrated the kind of growth potential that should make businesses 
who need technology services take notice. USPAACC's [mission](https://uspaacc.com/about) is 
"to be the gateway to corporate and government contracts...and...Pan Asian American...suppliers." We look forward to building
new relationships and to delivering our services to even more clients in the Washington, DC, area and beyond. We are also excited about expanding
our current offerings by making our courses available online and building new software products.

We want to thank USPAACC for recognizing Vidya's past success and future potential, and we cannot wait to do business
with you. [Let's talk](/contact).
