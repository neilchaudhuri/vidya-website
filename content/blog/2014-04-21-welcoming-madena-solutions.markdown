Vidya is proud to be working with [Madena Solutions](http://madenasolutions.com/), a consulting company committed to
bridging the gap between Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Plan providers and the Centers For Medicare
&amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Madena facilitates enrollment, coordinates member data and payment records among disparate
databases, and performs countless other business process improvements.

We are helping Madena document a complex [Java](/tags/java) application with a lot of intense stored
procedures and queries. The application reconciles the data between providers and CMS according to complicated business
rules, reports on discrepancies, and provides a nice visualization to help users understand whatâ€™s going on with Medicare
providers and beneficiaries.

Madena has also asked us to identify areas of improvement for the next version of the application. While there will of
course be a focus on modernizing the technology stack, we will also recommend improvements in the development
process with things like build and test automation and continuous integration to promote transparency and quality.

We are excited to be working with Madena not only for the technical challenge but also for the broader goal of making
Medicare work better for everyone.
