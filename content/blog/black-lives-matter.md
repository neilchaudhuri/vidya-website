Black Lives Matter.

While we at Vidya have made it [very clear](/about) that diversity in tech has always been a priority and that we have zero tolerance
for racism, I am sorry it took so long for me to state those words in this space. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [Breonna Taylor](https://www.gofundme.com/f/9v4q2-justice-for-breonna-taylor) *in her sleep in her home* 
when police executed a no-knock warrant without any announcement or any regard for the black lives inside. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [George Floyd](https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd) by a police officer who smugly ignored the desperate pleas of onlookers as 
he cruelly drained the life out of Mr. Floyd over eight and a half agonizing minutes. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [Elijah McClain](https://www.gofundme.com/f/elijah-mcclain), who played violin for animals at the
local shelter and who was on his way home with iced tea for his brother when police descended upon him. He begged them 
to listen as he pleaded "*I’m an introvert. I’m just different. That’s all. I’m so sorry*" 
only to be choked, injected with ketamine, and left for dead while police and first responders chatted about things.

I am sorry it took the lynching of [Ahmaud Arbery](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/a-marathon-in-memory-of-ahmaud-arbery), 
who was pursued, attacked, and murdered *while jogging* by white supremacists, who stood over his body and cursed him using
the worst language imaginable.

I am sorry it took the breathtaking privilege of Amy Cooper, who was so angry at [avid birder  
Christian Cooper](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/869052336/-blackbirdersweek-seeks-to-make-the-great-outdoors-open-to-all) for 
merely asking her to follow the rules and leash her dog that she called police and lied,
"There's an African-American man recording me and threatening myself and my dog" with implicit knowledge and smug assurance
that she has at her command an instrument for killing black people. In fact, Amy Cooper's disgusting behavior undermines 
completely the "[bad apples](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2020/05/30/bad-apples-come-from-rotten-trees-in-policing/)" 
argument made so often in defense of police and an entire criminal justice apparatus who destroy black lives.

I am sorry I can't list the names of all the innocent black cis and trans lives going back centuries that we have lost to systemic,
institutionalized racism and white supremacy sanctioning police brutality, corruption in the criminal justice system,
terrorism, redlining, mass incarceration, climate change, political disenfranchisement, 
insufficient investment in health care and education and black entrepreneurship, and countless other insidious tactics.

I am sorry conventional media, social media, and elements of our politics are motivated to conflate activism for black lives with 
"politics." They make money and gain power by stoking division and outrage, and we need ways to 
undermine these perverse incentives.

It's far too late but I am finally stating it here on the Vidya website: **Black Lives Matter**

It's time to act. It was always time to act.

# What will we do about it?

Not enough. It will never be enough. But we can try.

At Vidya we have made longstanding efforts to promote black people, particularly black women, in STEM and of course technology through
our [courses](/course), talks at conferences, and volunteering to support organizations that help black women build careers
in technology, and we will expand these efforts. Still, this moment calls for much more. We will work in the following areas
to build technology solutions that support black lives. Please [contact us](/contact) if you have ideas or would like to collaborate.

### Data science 

In her book [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/), mathematician and data scientist 
Cathy O’Neil describes why we are foolish to have so much faith in the "objectivity" of the data models we use to solve racial bias. 
Data models derived from unconscious bias produce biased outcomes. 

Northpointe’s COMPAS algorithm to predict the likelihood of recidivism for criminal defendants 
[turned out to be a disaster](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) because
it underestimated the recidivism of white defendants and overestimated the recidivism of black defendants. 

This is such a hard problem that even Amazon has bungled it. A test of Amazon's facial recognition algorithm Rekognition 
generated an unnerving number of [false positives matching members of Congress against a database of 
mugshots](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28), 
and these false positives were disproportionately biased against people of color.

If only Northpointe and Amazon were as clever with the reliability of their algorithms as they were with the names of their algorithms.

These catastrophic failures aside, there will only be more data analytics not less, and the predictions and decisions by these
models will have a profound impact on black lives. We will be working on products and services that leverage open-source
tools like [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/) to build data models that minimize bias and produce fair outcomes
that we hope will help black people overcome institutional racism across society.     

### Software solutions

Data architectures ingest, transform, store, and index data that ultimately become the basis for training
models, and continuous delivery promotes these models to production systems where they can be queried and visualized to yield
valuable insights and prompt further analysis. 

Software drives this architecture. 

There is a litany of open-source and commercial cloud software dedicated to all of these concerns. In fact,
Palantir offers a complete enterprise 
solution--[but for evil](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kx4z8/revealed-this-is-palantirs-top-secret-user-manual-for-cops).

The universe of software applications that can help save black lives is vast. From mobile applications that automate
recording and notifications about encounters with police to those that help black people overcome voter suppression to
make their voices heard. From APIs that enable data sharing to promote better health outcomes for black women who are 
disproportionately vulnerable to COVID and whose maternal mortality rates are far too high to APIs that convey which 
communities need the most investment to improve their schools. From simple websites that organize content, disseminate 
information, and collect donations for fledgling organizations to clever voice assistant technology that provides information
on your rights when police demand entry into your home and also notifies loved ones of your situation. 
 
And on and on.

The problems are of course vast; the solutions complex. Vidya will build software to make the incremental
progress we need to save black lives.

### Nomenclature

It has always troubled us that the field of software engineering has featured offensive terminology. Thankfully, 
[we have not been alone](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8x7akv/masterslave-terminology-was-removed-from-python-programming-language) 
in our concern.

In distributed computing, people often speak of a "master" node managing "slave" or "worker" nodes in a cluster. How about "primary" 
and "replica"?
 
In cybersecurity, people often refer to "blacklisting" users or IP addresses that are deemed threats and 
"whitelisting" those that are deemed safe. How about "block" or "deny" and "allow" or "accept"?
 
In distributed version control systems like Git, people often call the main line branch of the code base "master." 
In fact, we are guilty of this in the name of following "standards" and "best practices," but part of being 
anti-racist is acknowledging where you have failed and fighting to rectify it. So how about "main" as 
[GitHub has promoted](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/)?
 
While lazy, privileged engineers and executives in the tech space decry these moves as "political correctness," there is no
reason we need to remind black people of the pain that has defined their experience, and it is cruel to dismiss it 
so casually just because it isn't our pain. We can express exactly what we want in a way that's inclusive *and* in fact
more accurate.    

Words matter. At Vidya our words will represent our values.
