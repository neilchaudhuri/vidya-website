Black Lives Matter.

While we at Vidya have made it [very clear](/about) that diversity in tech has always been a priority and that we have zero tolerance
for racism, I am sorry it took so long for me to state those words in this space. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [Breonna Taylor](https://www.gofundme.com/f/9v4q2-justice-for-breonna-taylor) *in her sleep in her home* 
when police executed a no-knock warrant without any announcement or any regard for the black lives inside. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [George Floyd](https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd) by a police officer who smugly ignored the desperate pleas of onlookers as 
he cruelly drained the life out of Mr. Floyd over eight and a half agonizing minutes. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [Elijah McClain](https://www.gofundme.com/f/elijah-mcclain), who played violin for animals at the
local shelter and who was on his way home with iced tea for his brother when police descended upon him. He begged them 
to listen as he pleaded "I’m an introvert. I’m just different. That’s all. I’m so sorry" 
only to be choked, injected with ketamine, and left for dead while police and first responders chatted about things.

I am sorry it took the lynching of [Ahmaud Arbery](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/a-marathon-in-memory-of-ahmaud-arbery), 
who was pursued, attacked, and murdered *while jogging* by white supremacists, who stood over his body and cursed him using
the worst language imaginable.

I am sorry it took the breathtaking privilege of Amy Cooper, who was so angry at [avid birder  
Christian Cooper](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/869052336/-blackbirdersweek-seeks-to-make-the-great-outdoors-open-to-all) for 
merely asking her to follow the rules and leash her dog (whom she clearly mistreats) that she called police and lied,
"There's an African-American man recording me and threatening myself and my dog" with implicit knowledge of all of the above--
that police are white supremacy's instrument for ending black lives and that she is welcome to tak advantage. 
In fact, Amy Cooper's disgusting behavior undermines completely the "bad apples" argument made so often in defense of 
police and an entire criminal justice apparatus who murder black people.

I am sorry I can't list the names of all the innocent black cis and trans lives going back centuries that we have lost to systemic,
institutionalized racism and white supremacy sanctioning police brutality, domestic terrorism, redlining, insufficient investment in 
health care and education, political disenfranchisement, countless other insidious tactics.

It's far too late but I am stating it here on the Vidya website.

# What will we do about it?

Not enough. It will never be enough.
