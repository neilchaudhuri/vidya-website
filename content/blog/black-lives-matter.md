Black Lives Matter.

While we at Vidya have made it [very clear](/about) that diversity in tech has always been a priority and that we have zero tolerance
for racism, I am sorry it took so long for me to state those words in this space. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [Breonna Taylor](https://www.gofundme.com/f/9v4q2-justice-for-breonna-taylor) *in her sleep in her home* 
when police executed a no-knock warrant without any announcement or any regard for the black lives inside. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [George Floyd](https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd) by a police officer who smugly ignored the desperate pleas of onlookers as 
he cruelly drained the life out of Mr. Floyd over eight and a half agonizing minutes. 

I am sorry it took the murder of [Elijah McClain](https://www.gofundme.com/f/elijah-mcclain), who played violin for animals at the
local shelter and who was on his way home with iced tea for his brother when police descended upon him. He begged them 
to listen as he pleaded "*I’m an introvert. I’m just different. That’s all. I’m so sorry*" 
only to be choked, injected with ketamine, and left for dead while police and first responders chatted about things.

I am sorry it took the lynching of [Ahmaud Arbery](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/a-marathon-in-memory-of-ahmaud-arbery), 
who was pursued, attacked, and murdered *while jogging* by white supremacists, who stood over his body and cursed him using
the worst language imaginable.

I am sorry it took the breathtaking privilege of Amy Cooper, who was so angry at [avid birder  
Christian Cooper](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/03/869052336/-blackbirdersweek-seeks-to-make-the-great-outdoors-open-to-all) for 
merely asking her to follow the rules and leash her dog (whom she clearly mistreats) that she called police and lied,
"There's an African-American man recording me and threatening myself and my dog" with implicit knowledge of all of the above--
that police are white supremacy's instrument for ending black lives and that she is welcome to tak advantage. 
In fact, Amy Cooper's disgusting behavior undermines completely the "bad apples" argument made so often in defense of 
police and an entire criminal justice apparatus who murder black people.

I am sorry I can't list the names of all the innocent black cis and trans lives going back centuries that we have lost to systemic,
institutionalized racism and white supremacy sanctioning police brutality, corruption in the criminal justice system,
terrorism, redlining, mass incarceration, climate change,
insufficient investment in health care and education and black entrepreneurship, political disenfranchisement, and countless other insidious tactics.

It's far too late but I am stating it here on the Vidya website.

**Black Lives Matter**

# What will we do about it?

Not enough. It will never be enough. But we can try.

Outside of our longstanding efforts to promote black women in STEM and particularly in tech through
training, mentorship, and talks, we hope to do many other things in support of black lives.

### Data science 

In her book [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/), mathematician and data scientist 
Cathy O’Neil describes why we are foolish to have so much faith in the "objectivity" of the data models we use to solve racial bias. 
Data models derived from unconscious bias produced biased outcomes. 

Northpointe’s COMPAS algorithm to predict the likelihood of recidivism for criminal defendants 
[turned out to be a disaster](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm) because
it underestimated the recidivism of white defendants and overestimated the recidivism of black defendants. 

This is such a hard problem that even Amazon has bungled it. A test of Amazon's facial recognition algorithm Rekognition 
generated an unnerving number of [false positives matching members of Congress against a database of 
mugshots](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28), 
and these false positives were disproportionately biased against people of color.

If only Northpointe and Amazon were as clever with their data science as they were with the names of their algorithms.

These catastrophic failures aside, there will only be more data analytics not less, and the predictions and decisions by these
models will have a profound impact on black lives. We will be working on products and services that leverage open-source
tools like [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/) to build data models that minimize bias and produce fair outcomes
that we hope will help black people overcome institutional racism across society.     

### Software solutions

Data architectures that ingest, transform, and store data that ultimately become the basis for training
models and promoting them to production systems where they can be queried and visualized are driven by software throughout
the architecture.    

### Training

### Monetary donations

We will be donating thousands to charity, which is a lot for us. If you are able, please consider doing the same. Here 
are just a few of the charities doing amazing work:
