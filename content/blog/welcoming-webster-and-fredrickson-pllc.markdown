Vidya is proud to work with [Webster & Fredrickson, PLLC](http://madenasolutions.com/), a law firm based in Washington, DC, 
specializing in the practice areas of whistleblower protection and employment, bankruptcy, and commercial law. Since the 
firm's inception, Webster & Fredrickson has won millions for clients who have suffered discrimination, 
retaliation, harassment, and fraud at the hands of business and governmental organizations.


Our first priority was to develop a website suited to the Webster & Fredrickson brand. Rather than load it with 
the visual flourishes common on modern websites, we chose a clean, simple design with an emphasis on 
responsiveness on mobile devices. While PHP isn't in our wheelhouse, we believed WordPress to be the best choice to 
provide the functionality Webster & Fredrickson needs for the firm to post news, for clients to contact the firm confidentially
and locate it on a map, for search engines to rank the site highly, and for all the other functionality you would
expect.

Our second priority was to ensure that Webster & Fredrickson could maintain the site on its own once it went live. To that end,
we created custom post types called `Attorney` and `Practice Area` so that the webmaster at the firm can not only add
conventional WordPress Posts and Pages but also `Attorney` and `Practice Area` posts as the firm grows and evolves. A custom
WordPress plugin allowed us to create a many-to-many relationship between `Attorney`s and `Practice Area`s, which made it
easy to link each `Attorney` with his or her `Practice Area`s and vice versa. Another plugin provides the freedom to customize
fonts beyond the default stylesheet we created in concert with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

The site is now live in the cloud, and it has been proven to be a big success for Webster & Fredrickson.

We are excited for the opportunity to work with Webster & Fredrickson, PLLC not only for the technical challenge 
of learning PHP and WordPress but also for the broader goal of helping the firm continue to help clients
exercise their legal right to fair treatment by business and government.
