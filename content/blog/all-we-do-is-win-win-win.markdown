I have written quite a bit recently about my longstanding passion for improving the way government procures 
technology and manages technology [projects](/categories/project-management). The administration has taken 
[many significant steps](/blog/Projects/Agile/Scrum/Programming/Testing/Architecture/2015/07/19/the-fix-is-in) toward that goal,
and I have played [a small role 
in the process](blog/Projects/Agile/Scrum/Programming/Testing/Architecture/2015/10/04/learning-the-playbook) to this point.

But that role is about to get [a lot bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqJ1mTkEuY).

As I wrote [before](/blog/the-fix-is-in), the 
[Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb) (OMB)--the largest office 
within the Executive Office of the President of the United States--
[challenged](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/digital-service-contracting-professional-training-and-development-program-challenge-2/) 
us to improve how government "builds and buys digital services." This Digital Service Contracting Professional Training and Development Program Challenge
had three phases:

- **Phase I:** White paper describing the concept for a training and development program for federal acquisition professionals
- **Phase II:** Documentation detailing the program design, oral presentation, and mock classroom training to a panel of senior federal leaders
- **Phase III:** Pilot for the program delivered to a cohort of ~30 students over several months

*Vidya was part of the team that won this challenge.* 

We partnered with ASI Government to complement their government acquisition expertise with our expertise in technology and 
the art of software engineering to provide a unique, adaptive curriculum designed to meet the needs of a diverse cohort. 
At the heart of our approach is what we call "agile learning." 60% of the curriculum is fixed, but the remaining 40% is adapted
to the needs of the students as identified with a pre-assessment and to whatever course corrections may be necessary over the
course of the six releases. 

I will have input into all the releases--including the capstone in Release 6, but I will be the lead for Release 5, which introduces technology 
concepts like APIs and cloud computing along with software engineering concepts like version control and [agile](/categories/agile) software
development. However, the goal isn't to turn government acquisition professionals into the cast of 
[The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/). The goal is to provide these professionals with just enough 
knowledge of technology and software engineering to know what they're buying and therefore design contracts in such a way as to 
motivate vendors to provide tangible, measurable value every day. Hopefully also the students will 
serve as evangelists upon returning to their agencies so they can disseminate the principles in our curriculum 
among their peers in government. 

This is [kind of a big deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8OxKx6zKkQ). The curriculum we are developing with our partners 
for the Phase III pilot will revolutionize government contracting and yield unprecedented value for American taxpayers. 
But it won't be easy. The pilot is already well underway, and the team will continue to work very hard to deliver on this promise. 
Many challenges lie ahead.

Still, I want to take stock and savor this opportunity. It feels so great to [win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J12IeS7BDoo).
