I had the opportunity to join a panel discussion hosted by [Frank McNally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankmcnally-govcon-marketing/),
Director of Learning and Content Development at Public Spend Forum, where we discussed cybersecurity procurement in the federal government.
Rounding out the panel was [Spence Witten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spence-aintfiredmeyet-witten), 
VP of security solutions provider LunarLine, who has a wealth of experience with federal procurement in the 
[security](/tags/security) space.

Check out why procurement officials need to take initiative when buying cybersecurity solutions (and how they can do it
both pre-award and post-award) and how security can be built into the software engineering process. And how we managed to 
make references to the [Stanley Cup Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Stanley_Cup_Finals) and Shakespeare and Hemingway. 

I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to [let us know what you think](/contact).
