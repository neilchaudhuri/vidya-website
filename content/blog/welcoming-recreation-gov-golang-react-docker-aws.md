Vidya is proud to have worked on the development of [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/), a site built for the United
States government using leading-edge technologies and practices to make it easier to visit the nation's most 
beautiful landmarks and national parks including [the Grand Canyon](https://www.recreation.gov/camping/gateways/2733) and 
[Mount Whitney](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/233260). 

Often called the "Airbnb for Camping," Rec.gov (as it is colloquially known) allows users to reserve permits
to visit and/or stay overnight at federal lands, waterways, and monuments. There are even lotteries
for those permits that are particularly in-demand. 

In order to meet the demand of thousands of visitors, Rec.gov has been built with performance in mind. It utilizes what is probably
the most innovative customer-facing technology stack in the federal government: 

* [Go kit](/tags/go-kit), a [microservices](/categories/microservices) framework written in [Go](/categories/go)
* Custom [React](/tags/react) components along with [Redux](/tags/redux) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [Cassandra](/tags/cassandra) for storage although there are plans to move to [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
* [AWS](/tags/aws)

The project itself takes something of a startup's view on quality by shifting the focus from functional testing to automation via a 
[CI/CD](/categories/continuous-delivery) pipeline powered by [Jenkins](/tags/jenkins) to build the microservices
and perform basic [linting](https://github.com/golang/lint), [Docker](/tags/docker) to build the images, 
and [Kubernetes](/tags/kubernetes) to orchestrate them. A dedicated [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/) team manages
this pipeline, and their work is impressive. I have never been on a development effort that seemingly devotes more resources to 
continuous delivery than to feature development.  
 
It is rewarding to have learned so much about these emerging technologies and, even more importantly, to have helped make
the best of America available to everyone.
