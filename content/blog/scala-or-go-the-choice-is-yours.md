[Scala](/categories/scala) and [Go](/categories/go) are two of the fastest growing leading-edge 
[programming](/categories/programming) languages in the world. In the United States, they are also among the 
[most lucrative](https://adtmag.com/articles/2017/08/18/go-scala-salaries.aspx). Scala and Go are among a slew of 
programming languages that innovate in numerous ways to produce faster, more resilient, more secure applications for a multicore,
[cloud native](/categories/cloud-native), [mobile](/categories/mobile) world.   

The thing is Scala and Go have *very* different philosophies on what makes engineers most productive and what defines great
applications. We are going to look at how Scala and Go solve five common programming tasks--null safety, error handling, 
collections, parallelism, and polymoprhism--and how their contrasting approaches reflect their contrasting philosophies.
Then you can decide for yourself which works best for your next application.

But first, let's look at the two languages at a high level.

## Scala

Scala is an object-oriented (OO) *and* [functional programming](/categories/functional-programming) language built for 
the JVM (though [Scala Native](http://www.scala-native.org/en/v0.3.8/) is in the works). It emerged from academia at the 
[EPFL](https://scala.epfl.ch/) in Switzerland from the mind of Academic Director Martin Odersky, who sought to prove that 
the two paradigms--OO for representing your domain and functional for its 
[mathematical guarantees for working programs](/blog/2018/09/18/the-business-case-for-functional-programming/)--can blend
seamlessly to yield the best of both worlds. Scala also has an exquisite type system (more later) that can provide a 
powerful safety net.  

Operationally, Scala tooling can be problematic and compilation can be slow, but the features of the language make you
very productive once you get the hang of them. When you want to experiment with something, you can skip the ceremony of 
writing a class or test and instead use a command line REPL, an online REPL called 
[Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/) which allows sharing, or an outstanding third-party command line REPL called 
[Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/#Ammonite-REPL).
