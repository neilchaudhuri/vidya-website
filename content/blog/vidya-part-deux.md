Welcome to the first new post on our brand new website! Thank you for checking it out.

At Vidya we pride ourselves on embracing emerging technologies and architectures and helping our clients leverage them to realize their
potential for their businesses. This website proves we eat our own dog food. We built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
a static-site generator built with the spectacularly popular [Go](/tags/go) programming language from Google, which continues
to shoot up the [Tiobe Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/go/). Go is a relatively simple programming language that 
aspires to do a few things well rather than deploy machine learning models, build mobile apps, end world hunger, and rid
the world of nuclear weapons like [Java](/tags/java). Go is also *very* fast, which is why it is excellent for concurrency. 
Hugo takes advantage of Go's performance to generate websites quickly. It also offers intuitive layouts, flexible taxonomies,
and numerous helper functions. It could use a native asset pipeline similar to [hugulp](https://github.com/jbrodriguez/hugulp), 
but overall building websites with Hugo (and Go under the hood) is really fun and easy. If you need a website, give it a try.

As great as Hugo is, the really cool thing about our new website though is that it is a [Progressive Web Application](/tags/pwa)(PWA).
We identified PWAs as a "trend in software engineering"
