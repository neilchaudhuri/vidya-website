The [Code Writers Workshop](https://www.codewritersworkshop.com/events/dc) is taking place outside Washington, DC on 
June 9th with the theme "Software Leadership in a New Era." The speakers are a diverse, distinguished array of industry leaders 
who have done great things around the world. The keynote speaker, Kara DeFrias, was Director of UX for former Vice-President Joe Biden! 

The surprising thing is they're letting me speak too. I have the honor of speaking on the topic "Here's What's Trending in 
Software Engineering."

I look forward to learning from all the talented people who will be speaking at and attending the conference, and I 
hope to provide some interesting information as well. Please get in touch if you would like to
attend. I will be happy to hook you up with a discount.

See you at the Code Writers Workshop!
