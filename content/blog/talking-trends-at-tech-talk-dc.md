I will be speaking at [Tech Talk DC](https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/events/243181157/) on October 25th in
Arlington, Virginia, on *Here's What's Trending In Software Engineering*. Whether you build software, manage projects, 
or run enterprises, you’ll discover tools, techniques, and technologies that will give you an edge in the years to come.

If you saw me speak on this topic at 
[Code Writers Workshop](/blog/2017/06/05/speaking-at-code-writers-workshop-2017/) in the summer, rest assured this talk will be different.
First, I have added some wrinkles to the original list you will likely find compelling. Second, since I will have more time,
I want to promote discussion. I look forward to hearing from you on why I may have exaggerated a trend and learning about trends 
you’ve identified that I missed.

This will be a fun event with free food, so if you are in the Washington, DC, area, I hope to see you there!
