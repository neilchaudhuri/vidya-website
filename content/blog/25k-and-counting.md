It's an honor and a privilege to have helped [2.6M developers and earned 25K points](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1347281/vidya) 
on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

For those who don't know, Stack Overflow is a Q&A site similar to Quora and Reddit that is essential to life as a software engineer.
I for one turn to it at least once a day to see if anyone else has tackled the same problem I'm tackling, and far more often than not,
someone has. The wealth of practical knowledge on Stack Overflow is breathtaking, and the site has grown into a mature platform 
that [conducts large-scale surveys and data analysis](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) to provide unique insight into the 
development landscape and even puts [job-seekers in touch with those looking for talent](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs).

As with any group of software engineers online, you will have a mix of undeniable talent, hardened opinion, and of course 
incessant trolling. This is still the Internet after all. There is a [Code of Conduct](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct),
but it strikes me as only mildly effective.

Over the years I have tried to help a lot of engineers. Some answers are certainly better than others:

* [How to write unit tests in Spark 2.0+?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43729262/how-to-write-unit-tests-in-spark-2-0/43769845#43769845). This addresses an important but underrated topic we discuss in [our Spark course](/course/analytics-with-apache-spark/). 
* [Difference between Throws in method signature and Throw Statements in Java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19193540/difference-between-throws-in-method-signature-and-throw-statements-in-java/19193847#19193847). This is a critical distinction we address in [our Java course](/course/software-engineering-in-java/).     
* [400 BAD request HTTP error code meaning?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19671317/400-bad-request-http-error-code-meaning/19671511#19671511). This is my highest scoring answer. I have no idea why.
* [What is the purpose of Gradle?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20787986/what-is-the-purpose-of-gradle/20788406#20788406). This addresses some key aspects of [continuous integration](/categories/continuous-integration) which is now more critical than ever.
* [Why is O(n) equal to O(2n)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19371489/why-is-on-equal-to-o2n/19371607#19371607). Because Big O still matters in real life.

Contributing to Stack Overflow can be intimidating
especially with a vocal minority of the community ready to attack you if your [question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) 
or [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer) is not deemed sufficiently rigorous. But you should take a chance and do it anyway.

For one thing, you can learn something new by confronting new problems in old areas of expertise. For another, the ability to 
communicate effectively on complex topics will benefit you throughout your career. You will also be more marketable as your
answers convey a level of understanding that job seekers armed merely with jargon-laden resumes can trust. And of course there
is the satisfaction of contributing to something bigger than yourself. Our community--from open-source to 
Slack channels to free tooling--is built on collaboration unlike few others. Be a part of that.

Now just like other social media, there will always be trolls on Stack Overflow who want to take advantage of their online 
anonymity to wreak havoc. They will be gratuitously mean. They will downvote your answers merely because they 
disagree with an opinion--or so it seems since they don't improve the conversation by leaving an explanation or making an edit
[in voliation of community guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-down). It's obnoxious, and frankly 
it used to bother me until I recognized something that should have been obvious from the start. In a field plagued by
[Imposter Syndrome](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/working-in-tech/imposter-syndrome/) and a 
[lack of diversity](https://qz.com/1624252/pythons-creator-thinks-it-has-a-diversity-problem/), it's up to privileged (as I am), 
good-faith (as I try to be) engineers like myself to get over trivial slights and use our privilege to turn Stack Overflow and all 
public technology forums into a safe space where everyone feels welcome to learn and contribute. 

So if you haven't already, please get started contributing your skills to Stack Overflow. I have been slacking on my 
responses lately, so you'll catch me soon enough.
