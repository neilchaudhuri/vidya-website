I spent most of my career building software for U.S. government clients as a contractor, and one thing I noticed is just
how bad the government is at running software projects. Take every bad thing every commercial software project ever did
in the 1990’s, and it was built into the government software development process. It's like modeling every high school
after [Bayside High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MftOONlDQac).

Eventually, everyone else caught on with the
infamous rollout of [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/), but even then pundits and politicians only sought to
examine that debacle through the prism of the politics of the [Affordable Care Act](http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/rights/).
It frustrated me that people used HealthCare.gov as a proxy for their views on the law rather than a cautionary tale on
how *not* to run IT projects.

Politics and ideology aside, the government has a technology problem.

We’ve seen this most recently with the [OPM hack](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/09/hack-of-security-clearance-system-affected-21-5-million-people-federal-authorities-say/),
but HealthCare.gov gave us what some would call [a teachable moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachable_moment).
The problem is most people learned the wrong lesson. Even alleged technology experts who took the time to examine the way HealthCare.gov was
executed often got their analyses [spectacularly wrong](/blog/Projects/Agile/Scrum/Architecture/2013/11/11/dont-go-chasing-waterfall).

It was in fact because of my desire to help improve government IT that I began writing for
[Government Computing News](http://gcn.com/Forms/Search-Results.aspx?query=chaudhuri&collection=GCN_Web) around that time.

To its credit, the Obama administration has taken the first step—[recognizing the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAmsi05P9Uw). The Government Accountability
Office produced a [report](http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/593091.pdf) on applying agile software development practices
in the federal government, and I was one of the “experienced users” interviewed for it. Meanwhile, headquartered in Washington, DC,
[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) was formed within the [Government Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000) to serve as a consultancy
staffed with expert designers, developers, and product specialists. 18F is the driving force between the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/),
a guide for government professionals on implementing the best IT, and the TechFAR, an update to the [Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)](https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=browsefar).
I [wrote](http://gcn.com/articles/2014/09/10/digital-services-playbook-tactics.aspx) about the Playbook for GCN.

While there are a *lot* of things that need to be fixed, I have always felt the root of the federal government’s IT
problems is the acquisition process—long before any code is written or you even know who will be writing it. The FAR remains the standard, but it
hasn’t adapted to modern best practices for software development. 18F apparently agrees, and it sponsored a white paper
challenge on [Challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov) seeking a blueprint for a course for federal acquisition
professionals on what they need to know in order to procure the best software. I joined a team as a co-author of one
of the white papers. I know you’re dying to know what came of that. You will be the first to know when I do.

It was during this process that I first met government acquisition expert [Frank McNally](https://twitter.com/NecessitysChild).
It turns out he is just as passionate as I am about reforming the federal IT acquisition process and producing great software as a result.

18F recently put out a blanket purchase agreement (BPA) seeking vendors for a new kind of acquisition process--one that
I’ve called for for a long time. For the first time, vendors had to actually *[build something](http://adsbpastats.herokuapp.com/#/)*
using real datasets, real open-source libraries, real source code, real version control, and even real unit tests and containers.
That’s cool. While this approach delivers working software--the [Holy Grail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwR9T-3H3t0)
of agile software development--to the government for free, it also signals to everyone else that lean software projects
deliver fast. You don’t need to wait months and years to see results.

Frank posted a nice [explainer](http://publicspendforum.net/lessons-and-govconhacks-learned-from-18fs-bpa/) on the 18F
Agile BPA complete with video snippets. He was kind enough to invite me to add my own commentary in the videos. I don’t
actually appear on screen, so you have every reason to watch the videos.

Commercial businesses have used lean and agile concepts to build the best software so they can reap efficiencies, value,
and ultimately profits for their shareholders. I am proud to play a small part in helping the federal government reap
efficiencies and value for the benefit of the American people.
