Vidya is proud to be working with [Thomson Reuters Special Services](http://www.trssllc.com/), a leading provider of
threat detection solutions. Their software analyzes billions of public and proprietary records
with innovative technology to deliver realtime, actionable intelligence to support sound decision making.

We have joined a team of senior engineers with a wide variety of expertise. Currently, we are using
[Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) in [Scala](/tags/scala) as the web application framework with an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) interface
to a backend [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) database. Performance
is critical, so aside from aggressive indexing, we are utilizing [Akka](/tags/akka) to build a highly concurrent, resilient
architecture. Aside from the current challenges, we look forward to helping evolve this application by re-architecting it
into [Nathan Marz](http://nathanmarz.com/)'s [Lambda Architecture](http://lambda-architecture.net/)
with [Hadoop](/tags/hadoop) and [Elasticsearch](/tags/elasticsearch).

We are lucky to be working with TRSS so we can learn from such a talented team and contribute our own expertise to
such interesting, challenging work.
