Please take a look at [my latest column for Government Computing News](http://gcn.com/articles/2014/06/05/top-software-development-technologies.aspx)
where I describe the four technologies that have most revolutionized software development in the last decade--with one notable absence.
Just to give you an idea, here is the unedited introduction.

<blockquote>
In his blog post The Great Works of Software, Paul Ford enumerates five applications that excel in longevity, popularity, and usefulness. Pac-Man made the list, so you know it’s a good one. Ford got me thinking--less so about software itself and more about the technologies that shaped the way it’s made. 


There are four technologies that in my view have done the most to revolutionize software development in the last decade. The technologies themselves are less important than the indelible impact they continue to have on the industry. Understanding this impact will help you consider new ways to attack your own problem space and build better software faster.


Without further ado, here is my list in no particular order. Though I warn you now Hadoop didn’t make the list.
