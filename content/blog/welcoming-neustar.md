Vidya is proud to be working with [Neustar](http://www.neustar.biz/), a leading telecommunications and cloud platform
company. You may not realize it, but every phone call, fax, and computer connection in North America depends on Neustar.
Why? In 1998, Neustar saved the 10-digit telephone number system from becoming a 14-digit system with a solution mandated
by the FCC, so every telephone company in North America has a physical interface into Neustar’s directory system.

We have joined a team of senior engineers in the NexGen group, which was established to expand Neustar’s cloud offerings
with a variety of technologies and platforms. Currently, we are on a [Scrum](/tags/scrum) project using
[Java](/tags/java) and Groovy to build a [REST](/tags/rest) billing API with
[Dropwizard](https://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/). Mix in some [Amazon Web Services](/tags/aws) and
 [NoSQL](http://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) with project automation with [Gradle](/tags/gradle) and
continuous integration with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/),
and you have a fun, challenging project. We expect to leverage
[Scala](/tags/scala) and other cool technologies to add value to this project and others down the road.

We are lucky to be working with Neustar so we can learn from such a talented team and contribute our own expertise to
such interesting, challenging work.
