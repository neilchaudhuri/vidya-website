Welcome to Vidya.

Vidya is founded on the simple idea that technology is awesome. It’s awesome to create technology people love, to
learn new technology that make hard things not so hard, and to empower people to do big things with technology when they
have enough trouble sending E-mails with attachments.

But I’ve been developing software and leading teams long enough to know that the technology is the easy part. Anybody
with a laptop and the inability to ask someone out on a date can hotwire something in the garage. Building software the
*right way* takes maturity, patience, and a commitment to quality to produce something that accomplishes big things in
the real world.

The name [Vidya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidy%C4%81) comes from the [Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)
for "right knowledge" or "clarity," and it is the goal of this company to share our knowledge of technology and of
building software the right way with everyone. Just take a look around the website.

You’ll find informative blog posts on many interesting technology and software project management topics. You’ll find
[video tutorials](/tutorial) from our [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)
accompanied by the files and source code referenced in the tutorials on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/VidyaSource)
so you can play with them yourself. You’ll find [courses](/course) for yourself and your organization to learn how to
build real software the right way. And you’ll find we are available to [consult](/consulting) on your project in whatever
capacity you want to help you deliver high-quality software on time and on budget.

Of course, knowledge goes both ways. Please tell us how you like our blog posts and tutorials, which topics you want us
to cover in future ones, where we messed up and could do better, and what we can learn from your knowledge and experience.
We’ve tried to make it as easy as possible for you to [contact](/contact) us.

The future is bright for Vidya. We have already built some strong relationships, and we have big plans for the future.
Online versions of our [courses](/course) to make learning as convenient as possible. Innovative software products
available from your computer and/or your phone. And who knows what else lies ahead? We hope you will join us to find out.

This is just the first blog post of many. Thanks for reading. Now let’s get to work.
