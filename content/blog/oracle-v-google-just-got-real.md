Please take a look at [my latest column for Government Computing News](http://gcn.com/articles/2015/01/07/api-copyright.aspx)
where I describe why the biggest names in technology are getting involved in the legal battle between Oracle and Google

> In November, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a brief with the Supreme Court of the United States asking the justices to reverse a decision involving Google and Oracle that would have profound consequences for technology if it stands. To understand why, it is important to look to history for context.
