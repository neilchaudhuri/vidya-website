At Vidya, we believe it is very important to give back to the community and help others any way we can. It is even better when we can do that in a creative,
interesting way.

Organized in DC by the [Washington Architectural Foundation](http://wafonline.org/), Canstruction welcomes competitors from the fields of
architecture, construction, and engineering to build structures entirely from cans of food according to the theme of the event. All food and donations 
from Canstruction ultimately go to the [Capital Area Food Bank](http://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/) to feed those suffering 
from hunger in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area.



We are proud to have sponsored architecture and engineering industry leader Dewberry at [Canstruction](http://www.canstruction.org/) DC 2014. 
This year's theme is “Play With Your Food,” so Team Dewberry used its collective expertise to build "Can-D-Land."

You can see a lot more photos from Canstruction DC 2014 on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.711839755561664.1073741830.514602035285438&type=1) page. 

If you are around DC through September 5, 2014, 
please stop by the [National Building Museum](http://www.nbm.org/) to check out Dewberry's 
Can-D-Land as well as all the other magnificent structures. You can vote for your 
favorite for The People's Choice award and even donate a few cans of your own. If you can't make 
it, you can [vote online](http://www.capitalareafoodbank.org/2014/08/canstruction-2014-time-vote/) as well.

In 2013 Canstruction teams donated nearly 56,000 pounds of food and $8,000 from People’s Choice votes--the equivalent 
of about 42,000 meals. Congratulations to Canstruction and 
Dewberry, as well as all the other participants, for their commitment to helping others. We are excited to be part of it.
