Please take a look at [my latest column for Government Computing News](http://gcn.com/articles/2015/02/12/devops-defined.aspx)
where I drop references to [Brangelina](http://juggmentworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/brangelina+sag_0_0.jpg) and
[Kimye](http://sites.psu.edu/bradenshepler/wp-content/uploads/sites/6254/2013/10/kimye.jpg) to explain why DevOps
