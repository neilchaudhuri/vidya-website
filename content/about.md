## Our mission

At Vidya, our mission is to make technology as fun and accessible as possible. The passion we have for technology
doesn't shut off at 5 PM, and we want to show you how easy it really is to do great things.

Maybe you're at a small
company or nonprofit where everyone has to wear a lot of hats, and someone has asked you to retool the website when you've
never done anything more complicated on the web than tagging people on Facebook.

Or maybe
you are an experienced software engineer tired of your job working on the same boring technology you mastered years ago, and you're
worried that your skills are slipping as technology accelerates around you. Why should [Tony Stark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o2ACEr9NmQ)
be the only one to build cool stuff?

Or maybe you just want something built fast and built the right way.

Or maybe you want a passionate ally in promoting diversity and equal, positive treatment in the information technology space.

No matter what you need, we want to be of service to you. 

## Our offerings

existing offerings. We are *very* interested in what you have to offer as well.

## Our name

[Vidya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidy%C4%81) comes from the
[Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) for "right knowledge" or
"clarity." We want to embody the learning spirit that is the essence of the word. In
software engineering, you learn every day--not only about all the technologies out there and the new ones emerging every
day but also about people and what they want to accomplish. We want to work with you to build knowledge and learn from
each other.

## Our swan

*Vidya* is associated with the Hindu deity
[Saraswati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati) because she is the Goddess of Learning.
In ancient Indian art and literature, she is often depicted wearing a spotless white 
[sari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari) and riding a white swan.

We just hope you like the swan more than [Billy Madison](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n91ckeyNvQU).

## Our founder

[Neil Chaudhuri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-chaudhuri/)
is the founder and president
of Vidya. He has well over a decade of experience building complex software applications using
numerous technologies for a wide array of commercial and government clients in the United States. His passion for
learning technology and writing code and teaching others to do the same led him to create Vidya. Neil
believes as strongly in the art of software development and building things the right way as he does in technology itself.

Neil is a United States government cleared professional certified as a
[Project Management Professional](http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx),
<a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/certified-scrummaster-(csm)">Certified ScrumMaster</a>,
and [Scrum Certified Professional](http://www.scrumalliance.org/certifications/practitioners/csp-certification).

Neil is the author of several papers and presentations.
<ul class="publications">
<li>Agile Project Management: PMBOK vs. Agile</li>

Neil has written [monthly columns](http://gcn.com/Forms/Search-Results.aspx?query=chaudhuri&collection=GCN_Web) 
for Government Computing News on a wide array of 
software engineering and project management topics. It isn't a high bar, but he was probably the funniest writer on there.

Neil was selected as one of the "experienced users" to contribute to a United States
Government Accountability Office report called *[SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: Effective Practices and
Federal Challenges in Applying Agile Methods](http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/593091.pdf)*. He is currently a member 
of the GAO Agile Expert Group, which advises the GAO on how best to audit government software development projects for their commitment
to agile--particularly Scrum for now--principles.

Neil worked on a team assembled by the Executive Office of the President to [revolutionize federal government contracting of digital
services](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/digital-service-contracting-professional-training-and-development-program-challenge-2/) 
to maximize value for American taxpayers through agile development and open-source.
