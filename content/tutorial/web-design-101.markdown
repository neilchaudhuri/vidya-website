## Understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This tutorial is for people brand new to web design who haven't done anything more complicated on the web than tag their
friends on Facebook. We will explore the basics of three technologies--HTML, CSS, and JavaScript--and how they fit
together to form the backbone of the web.
